# Automatic-Clothes-Drying-Stand-using-Arduino-Servo-Raindrop-Sensor-
An Arduino-based smart drying stand that uses a Raindrop sensor to detect rain and a DHT11 sensor to monitor humidity. A servo motor automatically retracts the stand when it rains or humidity is high, ensuring clothes stay dry. Energy-efficient and fully automated, this system simplifies laundry drying.
